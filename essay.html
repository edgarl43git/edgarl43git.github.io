        <h1>The Barbershop</h1>
        <p style="margin: 50px;">The Barbershop, The Place of Regret
            We were deep in the center of Chinatown, in front of a barber shop. I’m five. A hidden sketchy basement with graffiti all over the place. I walk down the stairs, nearly tripping over each step. I open the door, the bells above jingle. Blinded by bright lights, through the reflections of polished wood floors, I sit down on the leather seats. The barber talks to me in Cantonese, “nei gei seoi?” I understand him, it's simple, he just asked me how old I was. I just don’t know how to respond. My grandpa responds for me, “ng seoi”. 5 years old. The barber starts cutting my hair.
            I walk out, and I’m bald. The classic haircut for a little Chinese boy.</p>
        <p style="margin: 50px;"> Afterwards, my grandpa and I go hang out. The bakery, to buy a snack and a juice box, the toy store down the street, to buy a toy, with my new haircut. Buying the stuff my mom would never let me get. I was happy, I wanted this to last forever. I wanted to show how happy I was but I didn’t know what to say to my grandpa who didn’t know English. We go to buy groceries, vegetables, and meat from the butcher shop. As we walk around the crowded streets of Chinatown, all I think is just how much I want to go home. Watch on the ipad, sleep, relax on the couch. My grandpa asks me about school, and I respond, struggling to find the right words in which he can understand.</p>
        <p style="margin: 50px;"> I’m ten now, the routine is the same. I walk down the stairs, this time, I don’t trip. The bells jingle. But this time, the other half of the barber shop is shut down. Maybe because they are going out of business. I sat down on my usual seat. The same barber that has been cutting my hair for my whole life comes up, and wraps the sheet around my neck. This time my grandpa and the barber had some small talk. About what school I go to, about my sister. “Nei fan bin gaan hok haau?” I heard the barber say. In my mind I have it translated: “what school do you go to?” My grandpa signals me to respond. I’m silent at first. I respond in English. “A school in Brooklyn.” I get out of the barbershop not completely bald, but with as little hair as possible. My grandpa offers to take me to eat lunch with his friends, and I decline. I think I wouldn’t fit in. I don’t know how to speak Cantonese that well. I don’t want to go. I want to stay home. I go home silently with my buzzcut. We enter the apartment complex, I go up to press the metal button for the elevator. Us standing in the center of the lobby, waiting for our lift, we are approached by another grandpa and grandchild duo. The kid is no older than five years old. He looks up to his grandfather. Speaking perfect Cantonese. </p>
        <p style="margin: 50px;"> I’m fifteen now, I tell the barber how to do my hair. I ask him in English, but does he really understand? Hopefully. I pray, after each cut, hoping that it’s not too short. Finally he takes the curtain off my body. The same routine follows. As I grab my stuff, my grandpa hands the ten dollar bill to the barber. We exit the basement, walking up the same stairs that I used to trip over. We buy groceries. On the same street as five years ago, I carry the bags full of watercress, and seafood. The same thing happens, we don’t talk. Oh how much I wish I went to that lunch. Even if there is a barrier between me and my grandpa, I wished I didn’t distance myself. I look at him, why don’t we talk? It’s me. That’s why. I can’t. Why did I learn how to communicate in my mother tongue? It was me, all these ten years. Every year I enter the barbershop, it was me that was stopping myself from talking to my grandpa, the barber. It was me who didn’t learn. It was me who created this distance, this regret. I don’t complain. I go home. I look at the mirror. “Keoi dei zing lyun zhuo ngo ge tau faat.” They messed up my hair.</p>
